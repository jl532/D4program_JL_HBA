currently working with 10 um resolution images only
Vary the position of the array within the cropped image
Vary the brightness of the capture spots
Vary the background noise of the arrays
Vary the smearing of the arrays


Encode the arrays as "single_array_#.tif", with the # being unique, increasing from 1 

then, within the attached excel file, code the number of the array with the corresponding slide image it came from, 
and we'll do comparisons of the arrays with each other for:
background noise
smearing

we will quantify the position and brightness of the capture spots using my verification code.
